A table of results could look like this:
	
FIXED EFFECTS
	Intercept 				The average test score across schools,reflected in the fixed effects intercept term
	NDVI
	MedHHinc
	Population Density
	Disadvantage
	Diversity
	
	Climate Region
	Metro GDP
	Police
	Rate - Total
	Rate - Violent
	Rate - Property

RANDOM EFFECTS
	Intercept				The variance component corresponding to the random intercept
	NDVI
	Residual
	
	MODEL FIT
	AIC
	BIC
	Deviance
	Log Likelihood
	
	
	

be used to partition the variance across levels. The intraclass correlation coe cient is
equal to 8.614 = 18.04, meaning that roughly 18% of the variance is attributable 
to the school-level.
